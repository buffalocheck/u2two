    Welcome to the 2017 CFB Confidence Pool!<br><br>
    Every week of the CFB season you pick the winner of each game & give that pick a confidence score between 1 and the number of games in that week's list (1 = least confident). <br>
      <br>
      When your pick wins its game you get those confidence points. At the end of the week we total everyone's confidence points & the person with the most wins!<br>
      <br>
      The games are between schools from these confereces:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ACC</li>
        <li>BigTen (except Rutgers)</li>
        <li>Big12</li>
        <li>Pac-12</li>
        <li>SEC</li>
        <li>Indi: BYU & Notre Dame</li>
    </ul>
   <p>Rutgers is excluded since they did not win any conference games in 2016. Games are on Thursdays & Saturdays but there's one on Monday 9/4. The # of games per week varies between 10 - 31.<br>Ex: week #1 has 10 games so if you pick them all correctly your perfect score would be 55 points. <br>
      <br>
      Here is a list of the total # of games and confidence points available:</p><br>
      <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Week 1: 10 games / 55 pts</li>
      <li>Week 2: 15 / 120</li>
      <li>Week 3: 15 / 120</li>
