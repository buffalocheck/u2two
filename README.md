Thanks for stopping by this readMe page.

This site is to be used for a sports pool for college football games. A player creates an account, picks the winners of each week's games and ranks those picks in order of confidence (1 confidence point being the least & the highest number being the most). At the end of each week the player with the most confidence points based on his/her picks wins the week.

Tech used: Facebook log in, 4 tables (details of 312 matchups & 65 college teams included).
